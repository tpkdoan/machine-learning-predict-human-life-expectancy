# Life Expectancy Prediction

Author: Tran Pham Khanh Doan - s3978798

This project focuses on predicting life expectancy based on various socio-economic and health-related factors using machine learning models.

## Dataset Description

The dataset consists of multiple features related to country-wise health statistics. Below are the key attributes:

- TARGET-LifeExpectancy: Life Expectancy in age (years)

- Country: index of Country
- Year: Year
- Status: Developed or Developing status (1, 0)
- AdultMortality: Adult Mortality Rates of both sexes (probability of dying between 15 and 60 years per 1000 population)
- AdultMortality-Female: Adult Mortality Rates of Female (probability of dying between 15 and 60 years per 1000 population)
- AdultMortality-Male: Adult Mortality Rates of Male (probability of dying between 15 and 60 years per 1000 population)
- SLS: Number of Short Life Span per 1000 population
- Alcohol: Alcohol, recorded per capita (15+) consumption (in litres of pure alcohol)
- PercentageExpenditure: Expenditure on health as a percentage of Gross Domestic Product per capita(%)
- Measles: Measles - number of reported cases per 1000 population
- BMI: Average: Body Mass Index of entire population
- Under5LS: Number of under-five Life Span per 1000 population
- Polio: Polio (Pol3) immunization coverage among 1-year-olds (%)
- TotalExpenditure: General government expenditure on health as a percentage of total government expenditure (%)
- Diphtheria: Diphtheria tetanus toxoid and pertussis (DTP3) immunization coverage among 1-year-olds (%)
- HIV-AIDS: Factor indicating between 0-4 years life span per 1000 HIV/AIDS 
- GDP: Gross Domestic Product per capita (in USD)
- Population: Population of the country
- Thinness1-19years: Prevalence of thinness among children and adolescents for Age 10 to 19 (% )
- Thinness5-9years: Prevalence of thinness among children for Age 5 to 9(%)
- IncomeCompositionOfResources : Human Development Index in terms of income composition of resources (index ranging from 0 to 1)
- Schooling: Schooling indicator

## Project Workflow

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Analyzing and visualizing the dataset to understand trends and relationships.

- Data Cleaning

- Data Preprocessing

- Model Building

- Hyperparameter Tuning

- Best Model Selection

- Apply to Test Data


## How to Run the Code

- Update the dataset directory to match your local setup:

- Open the Jupyter Notebook file (.ipynb).

- Run all cells sequentially from top to bottom.
